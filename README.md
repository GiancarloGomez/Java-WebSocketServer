# Java WebSocket Server

This project is a simple Java WebSocket Server which supports namespaces and channels. This is a WIP at the moment as I learn how to work with [Eclipse Tyrus 2.1.5](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.tyrus/releases/2.1.5).

## Future Goals
Deploy as a module for [BoxLang](https://boxlang.io/)
